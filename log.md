# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Work on creating a REI Calculator

**Thoughts:** Goal is to create a HTML form that takes inout of numbers and then use Javascript to output a check against some REI rules of thumb. Need to start figuring out how to use css to make it look spiffy rather than just a plain display. Maybe start looking at creating a template to work on each file.

### Day 0: January 12, 2017
##### Commitment

**Today's Progress:** Got started with setting up a webpage for a custom domain name on github pages 

**Thoughts:** Setting up was easy. Unfortunately adding a redirect and cname record on current registrar not so much. Transferring registrars and hopefully things go smooth. Started the free code camp examples and did some very basic html reading.
