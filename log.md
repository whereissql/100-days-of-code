### Day 4: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - Add to-do list, FreeCodeCamp continue to review HTML/CSS

**Thoughts:** Created a list of to-do items for the REI Calculator page. Read about pulling data from database using AJAX/JQuery. So I know what I need to get into next. However, instead of getting into the shiny object syndrome. I'd like to get some more practice on Javascript and HTML/CSS work on FreeCodeCamp (will call fcc from now on).

### Day 3: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - display results

**Thoughts:** Local testing produced same result of form not having innerHTML display more than 2 seconds. When thinking of code execution I realized that the problem is having button inside form. So once it reaches close tag for form, it probably disppears.

Works as expected, after moving button out. Big thumbs up! Did some of the calc displays and looks decent. Now need to add some more validation and code.

### Day 2: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - display results

**Thoughts:** Plan was to take the input from user on page and display results of some rules of thumb analysis and maybe add some input verification. I first tried to display it on page using innerHTML. It does the display, but clears it in about 1 or 2 secs. Not sure if this is because I'm trying to look at the webapge through gh-pages. Research with google didn't turn up anything. Need to try and see from local instead.

### Day 1: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Work on creating a REI Calculator

**Thoughts:** Goal is to create a HTML form that takes inout of numbers and then use Javascript to output a check against some REI rules of thumb. Need to start figuring out how to use css to make it look spiffy rather than just a plain display. Maybe start looking at creating a template to work on each file.

Also started going through FreeCodeCamp exercises and writing down git commands as I use them.

### Day 0: January 12, 2017
##### Commitment

**Today's Progress:** Got started with setting up a webpage for a custom domain name on github pages 

**Thoughts:** Setting up was easy. Unfortunately adding a redirect and cname record on current registrar not so much. Transferring registrars and hopefully things go smooth. Started the free code camp examples and did some very basic html reading.
