# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Read chapter 4(Arraya and Objects) on eloquent javascript. Read chapter 1 on YDKJS

**Thoughts:** Decided to take the plunge and read Chapter 1 on You Don't know JavaScript. Seems like an interesting book and went through the intro reasonably quick. I like the logic behind the book, but afraid that I may be usig too many books and methods to learn from all at once. I think I will shelve it for now and continue with fcc and eloquent.

While reading the chapter on Arrays and Objects, I realized I probably need to re-read Functions (chapter 3) and Arrays and Objects (chapter 4) one more time to refresh my memory. I'm not reading every day and with a break of a couple days, I notice some of the concepts are not retained.

I started with the tribute page which will be on Terry Fox.

### Day 14: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** jQuery - fcc completed

**Thoughts:** Completed jQuery exercises (Waypoints) on fcc. This time I took notes, as opposed to previous attempts at working with fcc. While actually typing code the second time on a page without auto-complete, helped me retain and understand a lot more.

Now there are some basic projects for tribute page and portfolio page, which should be interesting. After struggling with plain html/css, I now appreciate the bootstrap and animate css that much more. lol.

### Day 13: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Bootstrap - fcc completed

**Thoughts:** Completed fcc's bootstrap exercises. Need a better way to organize files and store the eloquent JS exercises. A little disappointed that my fcc activity is not recorded because I have previously completed these exercises.

I also found a fcc forum post that led me to a free six book series of "You Don't Know Javascript". I starred it on git, but I'm worried I might get back into the shiny object syndrome and lose focus. For now I'll stick with fcc curriculum and go there if I need to. There are also some other books/courses that I have purchased in the past that I have been thinking of starting.

### Day 11: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Bootstrap - fcc. Eloquent JS - Repeat chapter 3 (functions), start chapter 4 (objects)

### Day 10: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Try to fix header on index page. Read about functions

**Thoughts:** Need to dive depper into fixing header. Tomorrow start Bootstrap exercises on fcc. Maybe leverage that for the header centering?

### Day 9: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Create a navigation menu bar on home page. Fix calculation on calculator. 

**Thoughts:** Looked at how to create a simple fixed navigation bar and went ahead and created it on home page. While testing out calculator, found a bug and fixed the code.

### Day 8: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Read eloquent javascript book through Ch 3. Add style changes to Jasons Playground. Start recording exercises 

**Thoughts:** Went through the book quickly because I knew the concepts. I'm expecting to learn more HTML/CSS by doing rather than reading about it, since I already have some basic knowledge on it and just need a refresher.

### Day 7: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** JasonsPlayground add some style to git commands page

**Thoughts:** I had previously created a document to note all the git commands I used and why. I added this to the index page and started thinking about how to add styles to it. Start with bootstrap code and read eloquent javascript.

Added a new article for CHARINDEX() on my SQL blog. Once I decided to add examples, I went down a rabbit hole of more complicated uses. This reduced my time on web dev stuff. Need to make sure to stay focussed on a smaller portion for the blog. I just made a note of to-do on the article itself and included a couple dead links for them. This will help me get to next topic and link to the one that made me think of them.

### Day 6: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC HTML/CSS + JasonsPlayground fix link

**Thoughts:** Fixed broken link to REI Calculator on homepage. Completed all FCC exercises for HTML/CSS. Will start with Bootstrap next. Need to implement some of what we learnt in the FCC HTML/CSS exercise to imprint.

### Day 5: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** FCC HTML/CSS

**Thoughts:** Continued working through some FCC exercises for HTML/CSS.

### Day 4: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - Add to-do list, FreeCodeCamp continue to review HTML/CSS

**Thoughts:** Created a list of to-do items for the REI Calculator page. Read about pulling data from database using AJAX/JQuery. So I know what I need to get into next. However, instead of getting into the shiny object syndrome. I'd like to get some more practice on Javascript and HTML/CSS work on FreeCodeCamp (will call fcc from now on).

### Day 3: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - display results

**Thoughts:** Local testing produced same result of form not having innerHTML display more than 2 seconds. When thinking of code execution I realized that the problem is having button inside form. So once it reaches close tag for form, it probably disppears.

Works as expected, after moving button out. Big thumbs up! Did some of the calc displays and looks decent. Now need to add some more validation and code.

### Day 2: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** REI Calculator - display results

**Thoughts:** Plan was to take the input from user on page and display results of some rules of thumb analysis and maybe add some input verification. I first tried to display it on page using innerHTML. It does the display, but clears it in about 1 or 2 secs. Not sure if this is because I'm trying to look at the webapge through gh-pages. Research with google didn't turn up anything. Need to try and see from local instead.

### Day 1: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Work on creating a REI Calculator

**Thoughts:** Goal is to create a HTML form that takes inout of numbers and then use Javascript to output a check against some REI rules of thumb. Need to start figuring out how to use css to make it look spiffy rather than just a plain display. Maybe start looking at creating a template to work on each file.

Also started going through FreeCodeCamp exercises and writing down git commands as I use them.

### Day 0: January 12, 2017
##### Commitment

**Today's Progress:** Got started with setting up a webpage for a custom domain name on github pages 

**Thoughts:** Setting up was easy. Unfortunately adding a redirect and cname record on current registrar not so much. Transferring registrars and hopefully things go smooth. Started the free code camp examples and did some very basic html reading.
